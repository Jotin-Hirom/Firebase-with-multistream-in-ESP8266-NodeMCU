# Firebase-with-multistream-in-ESP8266-NodeMCU
An IoT-based ESP8266 program that connects to Firebase Realtime Database to monitor and control devices remotely. It reads sensor data and sends it to Firebase while also checking for updates to the Firebase database that can control connected devices.

Here is the some explantion to the code:
1. The FirebaseData object manages communication with Firebase. MAX_DEVICES is a limit for the devices controlled in this project, and devicesKeys and devicesValues hold device information.
2. Wi-Fi Connection: Connects to the specified Wi-Fi network and prints the device's IP address on success.
3. Firebase Initialization: Sets up Firebase with the database host and authentication key, enabling automatic Wi-Fi reconnection and configuring data buffer sizes for handling larger responses.
4. Start Firebase Stream: Begins streaming data from the specified devices path in Firebase to receive real-time updates.
5. Firebase Stream Check: Continuously checks the Firebase stream. If there is an error or timeout, it prints the reason.
6. Handle Stream Data: If data is available in the stream, it calls printResult() to process the data.
7. Data Type Check: Based on dataType, the function reads and prints the value.
8. JSON Parsing: If the data is in JSON format, the JSON data is parsed to extract device switch states. A dynamic boolean array deviceSwitch is used to store each device's on/off state.
9. Control Devices: Based on each device's state (switch), it uses GPIO(General Purposes Input Output) pins to turn devices on or off.

Workflow
->. Connect to Wi-Fi and Firebase: The ESP8266 connects to Wi-Fi and then initializes Firebase.
->Listen to Firebase Stream: The ESP8266 listens for any data changes in Firebase under the /Mac Japan/Devices path.
->Parse and Control Devices: When Firebase data changes, the ESP8266 reads the data, parses JSON to determine each deviceâ€™s switch state, and turns devices on or off accordingly.
